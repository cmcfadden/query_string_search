Each of your movies have these properties\r\n\r\n- Rating: returns \"PG\", \"R\", etc. Can also return nil\r\n- Year: returns the year the film was released\r\n- Title: The movie's title\r\n- Star Rating: returns a number 1 to 5\r\n- Home Formats: returns an array of available home formats. `[\"DVD\", \"BD\"]`, for example.\r\n\r\nThe API Search gem will give you the following search functionality:\r\n\r\nQuery String Example  | What Data is Returned\r\n------------- | -------------\r\n`movies` | All data in your data set\r\n`movies?q=rating=all` | Movies with a non-nil rating\r\n`movies?q=rating=none` | Movies with a nil rating\r\n`movies?q=year=1994` | Movies with a year of 1994\r\n`movies?q=year=1994|1995` | Movies with a year of 1994 or 1995\r\n`movies?q=title=Dunston%20Checks%20In` | Movies with the title Dunston Checks In\r\n`movies?q=star_rating>1` | Movies with a star rating greater than one\r\n`movies?q=star_rating<3` | Movies with a star rating less than three\r\n`movies?q=star_rating>=2` | Movies with a star rating greater than or equal to 2\r\n`movies?q=star_rating<=4` | Movies with a star rating less than or equal to 4\r\n`movies?q=home_formats=DVD` | Movies that are available on DVD.\r\n`movies?q=home_formats=DVD|BD` | Movies that are available on DVD or Blu Ray\r\n\r\n### Combining Searches\r\n\r\nAny of the above critera can be combined. \r\nJust separate criteria with commas. \r\nRecords that match **all** the criteria will be returned. \r\nSome examples!\r\n\r\n`movie?q=year=1994,country=US,rated=none`<br />\r\n All un-rated movies made in the US in 1994.\r\n\r\n`movie?q=home_formats=BD|DVD,rated=R|PG,star_rating>3`<br />\r\nAll movies available on BD or DVD, that are rated R or PG, and that have a star rating greater than 3\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\nThis gem fits best when you're trying to provide very flexible searching on a relatively small and flat set of data. Because it filters a data set that you provide, the speed at which it works is wholly dependent on the size of your data set.\r\n\r\nWe currently use this gem on a small (~2000 rows) data set which is cached in memory. Response times using Rails/Passenger/Apache are always under 100ms, usually under 50ms. That's plenty fast! But if your initial data set is massive, or you can't cache it, your response times will be slower. Such is life. Gems like [Periscope](https://rubygems.org/gems/periscope) or [has_scope](https://rubygems.org/gems/has_scope) may be more your speed.\r\n\r\nA downside of gems like those, though, is that you end up defining all of your filtering methods in advance. This is not the case with Query String Search. If the elements in your data set respond to a method, then the data can be filtered by the return value of that method. It is possible that this is not what you want. In which case, check out those other gems. Or, you could also wrap your object instances in a wrapper that only responds to the methods that you want to filter on.\r\n\r\nAlso, this gem is platform and persistence agnostic. Rails? Sinatra? Cuba? Redis? Postgres? Doesn't matter. You pass it objects, it filters them down based on the query string.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFirst, create a collection of data. With ActiveRecord or other ORMs this is straightforward:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nMovie.all\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr something similar. As long as it returns a collection of objects, you should be good.\r\n\r\nThe objects must respond to the methods you want to search on. Say you want to allow a search string like this:\r\n\r\n`movies?q=year=1994`\r\n\r\nThen every object in your data collection needs to respond to `year`.\r\n\r\nSecond, search! In Rails you can do something like this in a Controller method.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef index\r\n  query_string = params[:q]\r\n  QueryStringSearch.new(Movie.all, query_string).results\r\n  #....\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returns a collection of the objects that matched the search criteria.\r\n\r\nOr you can do it not in the controller. This will work:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nQueryStringSearch.new(Movie.all, \"country=us\").results\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou get the idea. Pass in a data set and a query-stringish string and you'll get results back.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'query_string_search'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n- Fork, branch, commit & pull.\r\n- Tests are required.\r\n- Don't go against our Rubocop style guidelines.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nÂ© Regents of the University of Minnesota.
